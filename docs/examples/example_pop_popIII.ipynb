    "One of the generic results of using [More Realistic Galaxy Populations](example_pop_galaxy) is that they tend to produce strong late-time absorption troughs in the global 21-cm signal (this was the point of [Mirocha, Furlanetto, & Sun (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.464.1365M). Our interpretation was that deviations from these predictions could indicate \"new\" source populations, like Population III stars and their remnants. Indeed, we found some evidence that such objects introduce asymmetries in the global 21-cm signal (see [Mirocha et al. 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478.5591M) for details). \n",
